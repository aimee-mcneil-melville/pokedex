# Pokedex Application

This Pokedex has been created for a user to view the original generation of Pokémon. Data is fetched from the PokéAPI, and displayed in a way that a user can view some information about all Pokémon in this generation, and select any Pokémon for further details.

Upon selecting one of these Pokémon from the left-hand side, further information about the Pokémon will display on the right-hand side.

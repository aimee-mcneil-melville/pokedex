# Boilerplate: React with Express, Vite and Tailwind

This is a starter project that uses Vite to bundle a React app and Express to serve it in production. Express is used in development to serve an API server. Tailwind is installed for styling.

Vite React App: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
Express API Server: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

Requests to `http://localhost:5173/api` are proxied to `http://localhost:3000/api`.

## Setup

- Use this template to create a new repo.
- Rename your repo according to the app you're building

### Installation

Clone the new repo to your local machine

```sh
git clone https://github.com/[your-account]/[your-app].git
cd [your-app] && npm i
```

To start the development server with a watcher that rebuilds your code, run `npm run dev`.
